Intility Templates for Create React App.

When you normally run create-react-app, you get a great simple starting point for developing React locally. However, the next steps are not instantly clear. Where do I get the Intility favicon? Which router should I use? Do I have to make the styles myself? How and where can I deploy it?

These very opinionated templates aims to give developers battle-tested sane defaults for Intility projects using React.
