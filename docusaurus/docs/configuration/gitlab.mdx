title: GitLab Repository
---

Go to [New Project in GitLab](https://gitlab.intility.no/projects/new).

Select a fitting name, it should be as globally unique and descriptive for your project as possible.

Take note of the Project Slug, as we'll use it later to configure the project in Sentry, SonarQube and OpenShift.

## Pushing your application

Create React App creates a git repository for you locally,
but you'll have to add the GitLab repository as a remote.
Copy the last three lines of the "Push an existing Git repository" example.
They should look something like this:

```bash
git remote add origin git@gitlab.intility.no:Group/intility-app.git
git push -u origin --all
git push -u origin --tags
```

The pipeline will fail initially, but don't worry, we'll set it up correctly in the next steps.

## Adding CI/CD Variables

In your project on GitLab, go to Settings -> CI / CD, and expand the Variables section.
We don't need to add anything yet, but it's here we'll add tokens and such in the other steps.
