Go to [New Project in GitLab](https://gitlab.intility.no/projects/new).

Select a fitting name, it should be as globally unique and descriptive for your project as possible.

Take note of the Project Slug, as we'll use it later to configure the project in Sentry, SonarQube and OpenShift.

## Adding CI/CD Variables

In your project on GitLab, go to Settings -> CI / CD, and expand the Variables section.
We don't need to add anything yet, but it's here we'll add tokens and such in the other steps.
