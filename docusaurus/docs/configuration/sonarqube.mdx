title: SonarQube
---

A SonarQube analyzation job is included in the GitLab pipeline.
To set this up, we'll need to create a project in SonarQube, and a token.

First, we need to [create a new project in SonarQube](https://sonarqube.intility.no/projects/create).

The project key should be the same as the repository slug in GitLab.
If you use something other than the repository slug,
you'll need to modify the `SONAR_PROJECT` variable in the top of the .gitlab-ci.yml file.

Then in the next step, either generate a new token, or select an existing one.  
Copy the token and add it to GitLab CI/CD variables with the name `SONAR_TOKEN`.
