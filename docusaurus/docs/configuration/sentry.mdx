title: Sentry
---

The project comes included with error reporting to Sentry, and a pipeline job to upload sourcemaps and create releases.
To set this up, we'll need to create a project in Sentry, the project DSN and an auth token.

### Create Project

Head over to the [Create a new Project page in Sentry](https://sentry.intility.no/organizations/intility/projects/new/).

Under platform, select React.  
For the project name, use the repository slug from GitLab.
If you use something other than the repository slug
you'll need to modify the `SENTRY_PROJECT` variable in the top of the .gitlab-ci.yml file.  
Select a fitting team, or create a new one, and hit Create.

You'll be taken to a Configure React page.
In the code example under Connecting the SDK to Sentry, copy the `dsn` value, and add it to GitLab CI/CD variables with the name `SENTRY_DSN`.

### Acquire Token

Go to the [Auth Token section of your Account Settings](https://sentry.intility.no/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/).

The only needed scope is `project:admin`.

Copy the token and add it to GitLab CI/CD variables with the name `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`.
