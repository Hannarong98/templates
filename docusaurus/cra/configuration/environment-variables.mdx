Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files.
By default you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_`.

By default, `.env.development` is included, which will be loaded when you run your app locally.

For more information, please read the [Environment Variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) section of the Create React App docs.
