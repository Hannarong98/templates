When working on large projects, it can bothersome to share secret and configuration between all developers.
Azure App Config solves this by hosting this configuration remote, and everyone with access can pull it.
The template supports this out of the box, and all it needs is an url to get started.

## Create App Configuration

In Azure, create an `App Configuration`, and go to it.

![App Config Endpoint](/img/azure-app-config-url.png)

Copy the `endpoint` URL, and paste it into the `AppConfig` field in `Properties/launchSettings.json`.

```json title="Properties/launchSettings.json"
{
  "profiles": {
    "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME": {
      ...
      "environmentVariables": {
        "AppConfig": "MY_APP_CONFIG_ENDPOINT"
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

The template is set up to use built-in credentials of your development machine.
This means that we need to allow your (or more) accounts to access the App Configuration.

Go to `Access Control (IAM)` in the sidebar, then click `Add` and `Add role assignment`.
Select `App Configuration Data Owner`, and your own account or a group.

:::info
If you do not have access to add role assignments, you should as someone with the role assignment `Owner` to do it for you.

You can now add Key-values in Configuration manager,
and they will be applied to your local development environment.

## Create Key Vault

In Azure, create a `Key Vault`.
When setting up access policies, allow the same group/users you set up in your App Configuration to Get and List the Keys and Secrets.

You can now add Key Vault references in the App Configurations Configuration manager,
and they will be applied to your local development environment.

## Use in development deployment

Since the config uses your machines credentials to access the App Configuration and Key Vault,
it won't automatically work with your development deployment.

To set this up, we need to grant your App Registration we set up earlier access to the App Configuration and Key Vault.

First, give it the `App Configuration Data Reader` role in the App Configuration.  
Then, give it Get and List permissions for Key and Secrets.

You also need a client secret for your App Registration,
create one in Azure AD -> App Registrations -> Your App Registration -> Certificates & secrets.

Set up the following variables in GitLab CI/CD under the `Development` environment scope

- `AppConfig`: The App Configuration endpoint
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The App Registration client id
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret you just made
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: The tenant id of your App Registration (check in your App Registrations Overview)

Lastly, we need to configure the development deployment to use these variables.
We do this by passing the variables we just set up to Helm:

```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml" {17-20}
deploy:dev:
  ...
  script:
    - oc login $OPENSHIFT_SERVER --token=$OPENSHIFT_TOKEN
    - helm upgrade
      --install $CI_ENVIRONMENT_SLUG ./Company.WebApplication1/chart
      --set nameOverride=$CI_PROJECT_NAME
      --set image.repository=$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE
      --set image.tag=$IMAGE_TAG
      --set registry.url=$CI_REGISTRY
      --set registry.user=$CI_DEPLOY_USER
      --set registry.password=$CI_DEPLOY_PASSWORD
      --set route=$ROUTE
      --set replicaCount=2
      --set secrets.Sentry__Dsn=$SENTRY_DSN
      --set config.ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=$CI_ENVIRONMENT_NAME
      --set config.AppConfig=$AppConfig
      --set config.AZURE_CLIENT_ID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID
      --set config.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
      --set config.AZURE_TENANT_ID=$AZURE_TENANT_ID
```

The development environment will now be able to connect and use the configuration from the App Registration and Key vault.

:::note
Don't worry, even though the `deploy:prod` job extends the `deploy:dev` job, the variables won't be set, since we only scoped them to the `Development` environment.
