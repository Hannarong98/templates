First and foremost make sure you have installed the [official dotnet SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 5 or above.

```shell
#install intility templates
dotnet new --install Intility.Templates
```

New templates should now be available to bootstrap new projects from. Use `dotnet new --list` to see available templates

```
  Templates                                                   Short Name           Language    Tags

  Worker Service                                     worker               [C#],F#     Common/Worker/Web

> Intility Api (Project)                             iwebapiproject       [C#]        Intility/Web/WebAPI
  xUnit Test Project                                 xunit                [C#],F#,VB  Test/xUnit
  Razor Component                                    razorcomponent       [C#]        Web/ASP.NET
  Razor Page                                         page                 [C#]        Web/ASP.NET
  #...
```

You will immediately notice the two projects `iwebapi` and `iwebapiproject`. These projects reperesent the same starting point, but
one comes with a solution file and one does not. This is currently the best way to provide templates for both scenarios - wether you're
starting from scratch or already have a solution going.

> ⚠️ **NOTE**
>
> These projects will most likely merge into one if or when the dotnet template tooling supports post-scripts that allows us to move files post installtion.

## Bootstrap new project using the template

You can either use the `dotnet new` command or Visual Studio -> New Project wizard to create a new project based on the templates.

```shell
# create project
dotnet new iwebapi -o MyService

# run project
cd MyService
dotnet run --project MyService/MyService.csproj
```
