## Virtual environment
There are two options for creating your virtual environment, either manually through ``poetry`` or PyCharm.

:::info
This section will cover how to use PyCharm. [Head over to the next page if you want to use ``poetry`` instead.](/fastapi/setup/poetry)
:::

### Creating a virtual environment

Open PyCharm settings and search for ``interpreter``

![Add interpreter](/img/fastapi/setup/add_interpreter.png)

Create a new interpreter from your Python:

![Create interpreter](/img/fastapi/setup/interpreter.png)

Open a new terminal in PyCharm (it will automatically be activated and install the dependencies:

```bash
poetry update
```

The ``update`` command both updates the ``poetry.lock`` file and installs the dependencies.


### Docker-compose

`docker-compose` is configured to run docker images for your development server, and for tests.
Ensure you have `Docker` and `docker-compose` installed, open a terminal and type
`docker-compose up`. This will spin up `redis` for caching and testing,
and if you selected `sqlmodel` also a `PostgreSQL` database for development use.

### Migrations
You can skip this section if you didn't select `sqlmodel` and have a database.

In order to configure the database tables to reflect your models, you must run migrations.
In this project, we use `alembic` to manage our migrations. Running migrations is done through the terminal:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```


### Configuring PyCharm to run the server

Configure PyCharm to use `uvicorn` locally, pointing to your FastAPI application.
It's important to run this on `localhost:8000` and not `127.0.0.1:8000` for OpenAPI authentication to work properly.
The `--reload` flag will ensure the server is restarted on every file change in the `app` folder.

First, click the drop down in the top right corner.

![Dropdown](/img/fastapi/setup/edit_configuration.png)

Click the `+` sign and select `Python`.

![Add new](/img/fastapi/setup/add_new.png)


![Select Python](/img/fastapi/setup/add_python.png)

Then configure PyCharm:

* Name: `Server`
* Module name: `uvicorn`
* Parameters: `app.main:app --host localhost --port 8000 --reload`
* Python interpreter: The one you created earlier
* Working directory: Your current directory

![Configuration](/img/fastapi/setup/server_config.png)

Click `OK` to save and exit. Run the server.

:::info
Remember to run `docker-compose` before attempting to run your server.
