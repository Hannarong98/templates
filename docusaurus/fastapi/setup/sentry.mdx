The project comes included with error reporting to Sentry and a pipeline job to upload sourcemaps and create releases.
To set this up, we'll need to create a project in Sentry and retrieve the project DSN.

## Create Project

Head over to the [Create a new Project page in Sentry](https://sentry.intility.no/organizations/intility/projects/new/).

![Sentry Platform Select](/img/fastapi/setup/sentry_asgi.png)
Under platform, select ``ASGI``

![Sentry New Project Name](/img/sentry-new-name-dotnet.png)  
For the project name, use the project slug from GitLab.
Select a fitting team, or create a new one, and hit Create.

You'll be taken to a Configure ASGI page.
In the code examples, copy the DSN value passed to `sentry_sdk.init`, and add it to your `.env` file under `SENTRY_DSN`.
