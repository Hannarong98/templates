If you selected `SQLModel` you should do the [official tutorial](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/) before making changes.
When you create or change a SQLModel in Python, the database needs to be updated as well.
We do this by generating (and potentially manually edit) migration files. This project has been shipped with
[``alembic``](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) based on the [testdriven.io tutorial](https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-sqlmodel/).
