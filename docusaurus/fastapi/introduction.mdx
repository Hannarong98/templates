This FastAPI template is intended for you to get a good baseline for creating your first FastAPI.

Before attempting to use this template,
it is *highly* recommended you do the [official tutorial](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
If you've created APIs in other Python web frameworks,
FastAPI differs from the others by:
* FastAPI is built on ``starlette``, so it's async first
* API first, MVC second
  * OpenAPI (aka Swagger) documentation are automatically generated!
* Fully type annotated, and types are used on runtime
* FastAPI has very few batteries included (compared to e.g. ``Django``). That's where this template is handy.
