A few questions you will be prompted, here with a more verbose description:

* ``full_name``: Required for ``pyproject.toml``
* ``email``: Required for ``pyproject.toml``
* ``project_name``: The folder name, and required for ``pyproject.toml``. Keep it short and simple!
* ``description``: Required for ``pyproject.toml``
* ``mypy``: **Strict** type checking. This is for advanced users but highly recommended to implement at some point in your project. This will configure ``pre-commit``.
* ``sqlmodel``: An ORM for ``FastAPI``. Select ``1`` if you need a database. This will create example APIs,
install ``alembic`` for migrations, add ``postgres`` to the ``docker-compose`` file etc.
