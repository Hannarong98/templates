The example code is set up to use authentication. For this to work, an App Registration has to be set up in Azure AD.

### UI

Head over to [Azure -> Azure Active Directory -> App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps)
with your Intility Account, and create a new registration.

![New Registration in Azure](/img/azure-new-dotnet.png)  
Select a fitting name for your project, this name will be presented to the user during consent.

Under `Supported account types`, choose either `Intility AS only - Single tenant` or `Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant`.
This can be changed later, so if you're unsure what to choose, select single tenant.

Leave the `Redirect URI` section blank.

Hit the register button, and you will be taken to an overview of your newly created registration.

![Finding Client ID](/img/azure-clientid-dotnet.png)

Copy the `Application (Client) ID` GUID and `Directory (Tenant) ID` and paste it into the `APP_CLIENT_ID` and `INTILITY_TENANT_ID` field in your `.env` file:

```text title=".env"
INTILITY_TENANT_ID=
APP_CLIENT_ID=
```

:::info
If you chose Multitenant, set the `INTILITY_TENANT_ID` field to `common`.

### Add an application scope

Go to Expose an API in your app registration, and add a scope.
You will be prompted to set an Application ID URI.
Use the suggested one, and hit Save and continue.

![Add a scope](/img/azure-add-scope.png)

Add a scope named `user_impersonation`, that can be consented by `Admins and users`.

You can use the following descriptions:
```
Access API as user
Allows the app to access the API as the user.

Access API as you
Allows the app to access the API as you.
```

## Swagger

In addition to creating an App Registration for the API itself, we need to make one for the Swagger client too.
Again head over to [Azure -> Azure Active Directory -> App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps).

![New Registration in Azure](/img/azure-new-swagger.png)  

Use the same name appended with `Swagger`.

Under `Redirect URI`, select `Single-page application (SPA)` and enter `http://localhost:5000/oauth2-redirect.html`.

Hit the register button, and you will be taken to an overview of your newly created registration.

![Finding Client ID](/img/azure-clientid-swagger.png)  
Copy the `Application (Client) ID` GUID, and paste it into the `SWAGGER_APP_CLIENT_ID` field in your `appsettings.json` file.

```text title=".env"
SWAGGER_APP_CLIENT_ID=
```

### Adding reply URLs

For each deployment of your app, you'll need to register it. You can do that by going to the Authentication page.

![Adding Reply URLs](/img/azure-replyurls-swagger.png)  
The first reply URLs we need to add are the localhost https URL, and the OpenShift deploy URL:

```
http://localhost:3000/oauth2-redirect.html
```

You can also add more later if you create more environments.

### Access API

To allow Swagger to talk to the API, you need to add API permissions to the Swagger app registration.
Go to API permissions, and hit Add a permission.
Under My APIs, find your API, select the scope(s) and press Add permissions.
