Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
By default only services (clients and servers) hosted on the same server can access each other. 
To allow other services to access your server you have to whitelist them using HTTP Headers manually or by using dependencies that helps you out with this.

:::info
CORS policy is enforced by web browsers, but needs to be configured by the APIs.
:::

We will use the NPM package [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) to configure CORS rules.

```typescript title="src/config/app.ts"
app.use(cors({ 
    origin: [
        'my-super-awesome-frontend.azurewebsites.net',
        'my-cool-background-process.azurewebsites.net'
    ] 
}));
```

There are many ways to configure CORS rules, for a more in-depth configuration documentation. See the dependency's [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)
