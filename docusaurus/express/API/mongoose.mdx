Included in this project is an `docker-compose.yml` file to run an local MongoDB database as an Docker Image, as well as an connection string in `index.ts` configured to connect to this database.

This file is located here: `assets/docker-compose.yml`

**NOTE: This is meant for local development purposes only! Please move the connection string to .env and use an external MongoDB database or an Azure CosmosDB with MongoDB API**
