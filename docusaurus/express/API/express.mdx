Express is a web framework for Node that allows us to create a HTTP server where we can create our API.
Getting started with an Express app is fairly easy and can be done by a couple of lines of code. This is great if you want to test something, but larger enterprise applications require a more robust structural layered design. 

You can find the easy to follow getting started guide at Express' homepage: ["Express Hello World"](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html). But in larger enterprise applications a more structured system is needed.

In this template i'll follow a multi-layered API architecture which divides the API into 3 layers:

- Routes and Controllers - This is where you handle the incoming requests
- Services - Where you execute business logic on the entity, e.g. fetching other entities, calculating stuff.
- Repositories and Providers - Where you execute requests and/or queries to the database.

**NOTE: In this architecture it is important that the communication between each layer always flows downwards or sideways, never upwards. Like a service calling an controller.**

Project folder structure
This repository contains an example of an multilayered API design structure, as well as an example API for an User entity.

â”£ ðŸ“‚ interfaces                     // This is where you define all typescript interfaces, types, enums etc.
â”£ ðŸ“‚ static                         // Folder for hosting static files.
â”— ðŸ“‚ utils                          // Other utility functions.
```

**To get you started this template provides a User entity with CRUD routes, controller, service and a repository for this entity.**
