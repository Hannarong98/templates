Express is a web framework for Node that allows us to create a HTTP server where we can create our API.

* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Express web framework for Node.js.

`npm install express`

* [@types/express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/express) - Typings for Express.js.

`npm install -D @types/express`

Getting started with an Express app is fairly easy and can be done by a couple of lines of code. This is great if you want to test something, but larger enterprise applications require a more robust structural layered design. 

You can find the easy to follow getting started guide at Express' homepage: ["Express Hello World"](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)
