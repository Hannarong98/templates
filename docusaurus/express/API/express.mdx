Express is a web framework for Node that allows us to create a HTTP server where we can create our API.

* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Express web framework for Node.js.

`npm install express`

* [@types/express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/express) - Typings for Express.js.

`npm install -D @types/express`

Getting started with an Express app is fairly easy and can be done by a couple of lines of code. This is great if you want to test something, but larger enterprise applications require a more robust structural layered design. 

You can find the easy to follow getting started guide at Express' homepage: ["Express Hello World"](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html). But in larger enterprise applications a more structured system is needed.

In this repo i'll follow a multi-layered API architecture which divides the API into 3 layers:

- Routes and Controllers - This is where you handle the incoming requests
- Services - Where you execute business logic on the entity, e.g. fetching other entities, calculating stuff.
- Repositories and Providers - Where you execute requests and/or queries to the database.

**NOTE: In this architecture it is important that the communication between each layer always flows downwards or sideways, never upwards. Like a service calling an controller.**

Project folder structure
This repository contains an example of an multilayered API design structure, as well as an example API for an User entity.
ðŸ“‚ src
â”£ ðŸ“‚ routes
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ baseRouter.ts        // This is where you will register all your routes, this router is exposed at `/api/v1`.
â”£ ðŸ“‚ controllers            // This is where you handle the incoming requests registered by the routers, only simple data validation is done at this level.
â”£ ðŸ“‚ services               // This is where you handle the more advanced business logic, like like logic that span across to other database entities.
â”£ ðŸ“‚ repository             // This is where you write the database CRUD-operations like database queries etc.
â”£ ðŸ“‚ models                 // This is where you define the Mongoose Schemas for validation.
â”£ ðŸ“‚ middlewares            // This is where you store all the custom express middlewares
â”£ ðŸ“‚ interfaces             // This is where you define all typescript interfaces, types, enums etc.
â”£ ðŸ“‚ utils                  // Other utility functions.
â”£ ðŸ“‚ config                 
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ appInsights.ts       // Configuration of the App Insights framework.
â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ mongoose.ts          // Configuration of the Mongoose framework.
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ app.ts               // Configuration the Express server.
```

**To get you started this template provides a User entity with CRUD routes, controller, service and a repository for this entity.**
