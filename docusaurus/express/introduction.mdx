Intility Templates for Create React App.

When you normally run create-react-app, you get a great simple starting point for developing React locally.
However, the next steps are not instantly clear.
Where do I get the Intility favicon?
Which router should I use?
Do I have to make the styles myself?
How and where can I deploy it?

These very opinionated templates aims to give developers battle-tested sane defaults for Intility projects using React.

## Create React App

Create React App is the main part of the development environment, these docs only covers the Intility templates for it.
This means that everything from the official [Create React App docs](https://create-react-app.dev/) applies to your project.
If you can't find what your looking for here, check the CRA docs.
