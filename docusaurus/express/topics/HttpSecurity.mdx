There are many ways to secure your HTTP Traffic. In this section we will explore some tools/middlewares we can use to secure the incoming traffic.

:::info
It's not a silver bullet, but these can help you secure your traffic a bit!
:::

This template implements these following security measures:

* **Security Headers:** [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) - Helmet is a tool to help you secure your Express app by applying various HTTP headers aimed at securing your API against known HTTP vulnerabilities.
* **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP):** [hpp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hpp) - HTTP Parameter Pollution, or HPP, is a vulnerability that occurs due to the passing of multiple parameters having the same name. There is no RFC standard on what should be done when it has passed multiple parameters. This vulnerability was first discovered in 2009. HPP could be used for cross channel pollution, bypassing CSRF protection and WAF input validation checks.
* **HTTP Content Length validation:** [express-content-length-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-content-length-validator) - To not have your application vulnerable to large payload attacks you can restrict the maximum allowed payload size for incoming requests.
