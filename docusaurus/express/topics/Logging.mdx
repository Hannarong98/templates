This template includes an `LoggingService` class for simple and informative logging. 
This service expands on the well known and well integrated framework [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston).

export const Highlight = ({children, bg, title}) => (
  <div
    style={{
      padding: '0.5rem',
      borderLeft: '10px solid ' + bg,
      margin: '0'
    }}>
    <span style={{paddingRight: '.2rem'}}><strong>{title}</strong>:</span>
    {children}
  </div>
);

There are several levels of logging. From most important to least important:

<div style={{marginBottom: '1rem'}}>
    <Highlight bg="var(--ifm-color-danger)" title="Error">Highly criticality information about non-recoverable exceptions and faulty states</Highlight>
    <Highlight bg="var(--ifm-color-warning)" title="Warning">Medium criticality information and recoverable exceptions</Highlight>
    <Highlight bg="#32CD32" title="Info">Low criticality application information</Highlight>
    <Highlight bg="#00BFFF" title="Verbose">Events related to code performance and infrastructure</Highlight>
    <Highlight bg="#FF1493" title="Debug">General debug information used in development environments with high verbosity</Highlight>
    <Highlight bg="#f0f0f0" title="Silly">When you just want to display some text...</Highlight>
</div>

## How to use

Create a new instance of `LoggerService` anywhere in your code and give it an label.

From that instance you have access to all the different logging levels. 

```typescript
const logger = new LoggerService('Server');

logger.error('Unable to connect to external service');
logger.warn('Skipping external request');
logger.info('Configuring service!');
logger.verbose('Created new entity');
logger.debug('Working?');
logger.silly('Just a silly message');
```

**NOTE: By default logging levels are set to `silly` in non production environments and `warn` in production**

## How to customize

Winston is a very dynamic framework and can be customized to emit logs to multiple transports.

There are several [core transports](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/blob/master/docs/transports.md#winston-core) included in winston, which leverage the built-in networking and file I/O offered by Node.js core. 
In addition, there are [additional transports](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/blob/master/docs/transports.md#additional-transports) written by members of the community.

For other customizations head over to the [Official Documentation](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) at GitHub.
