## Mongoose and MongoDB

Mongoose is an ORM (Object–relational mapping) for MongoDB that helps you with the more advanced interaction with MongoDB. 

Some of the features mongoose helps you with are:

- Population of foreign keys
- Simpler querying
- Static modelling
- Data validation
- ... much more!

Included in this project is an `docker-compose.yml` file to run an local MongoDB database as an Docker Image, as well as an connection string in `index.ts` configured to connect to this database.

This file is located here: `assets/docker-compose.yml`

**NOTE: This is meant for local development purposes only! Please move the connection string to .env and use an external MongoDB database or an Azure CosmosDB with MongoDB API**

## Other Databases

For other SQL-like databases it is recommended to utilize an ORM (Object–relational mapping) framework. The most popular ones are:

* [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) - Main Documentation
* [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/) - Main Documentation

## Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API)

* [@azure/cosmos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/cosmos) - Azure Cosmos DB
