One of the most important parts of an application is its documentation.

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and the [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) has become the de facto standard for API documentation.
At Intility there is a requirement for API documentation using Swagger.

Writing an OpenAPI documentation is a tedious task, both to write the first time as well as maintaining and updating.
So in this template we'll be using the [express-jsdoc-swagger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-jsdoc-swagger) for autogenerating the OpenAPI documentation as well as hosting the Swagger page on our API.

:::info
There is currently an issue with the Authorization flow built into Swagger doc. There fore we will be hosting our own redirect logic. This can be seen in the `src/static` folder
:::

The Swagger doc will be hosted at `<BASE_URL>/api-docs`. This can be changed in the `swaggerOptions` object in `config/swagger.ts`. 
This might break the default redirection logic provided by us.

For an example on how to provide documentation for endpoints and interfaces. Have a look at the example routes and interfaces provided at `routes/` and `interfaces/`.
